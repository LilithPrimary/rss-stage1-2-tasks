					First of all, starting with interesting things. In the ads for employees the companies write: You need to know
					html, css, js, ts, python, java, c, assembler, many other scary words… and framework. Prefer React. Ok, but
					from official documentation we know that React is a Javascript library. Who is the lier?

					<p> Let's see. Both - libraries and frameworks - are reusable code written by someone else.
						Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways.
						But we have some differences.
						A stupid example – sorry for that. A library is like building your own desktop. You can choose any
						components
						that you like. You can add some features. But you don't need to design your own video card or assemble a
						monitor
						from an old TV - someone else has already done it for us and we can use it. But if you want - you can =).
					</p>

					<p>A framework is something like Apple. You have no choice. No, of course, you can influence the amount of
						memory, for example, but you will not be able to collect something of your own. Apple clearly dictates where
						you can do something and where you are powerless.</p>

					<p> Little stupid example, but something like this. This technical difference between a framework and library
						called inversion of control. The framework manages the programmer's code, not the programmer manages the
						framework</p>

					When we talk about React, it may seem that we mean the creation of browsers web applications. But no, React is
					independent of the browser and designed to create a user interface. For rendering components in browser we use
					React DOM library. We can also use React to create apps for iOS and Android. For this we need React native
					library.

					Ok, let’s find out why it is so cool.

					React DOM. Document Object Model. Represents the User Interface of your application. Every time there is a
					change in the state of your application UI, the DOM gets updated to represent that change.

					The DOM is represented as a tree data structure. Because of that, the changes and updates to the DOM are fast.

					But after the change, the updated element and its children have to be re-rendered to update the application
					UI. The re-rendering or re-painting of the UI is what makes it slow. Therefore, the more UI components you
					have, the more expensive the DOM updates could be, because they would need to be re-rendered for every DOM
					update.

					DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern web. Unfortunately, it is also a lot slower than most JavaScript
					operations. This slowness is made worse by the fact that most JavaScript frameworks update the DOM much more
					than they have to.
					For example, let’s imagine that you have a list that contains ten items. You change first item. Most
					JavaScript
					frameworks would rebuild the entire list (it's not my words, I find it in internet!). That’s ten times more
					work than necessary! Only one item changed,
					but the rest nine was rebuilt too.
					To solve this problem, the people at React invent something called the virtual DOM.

					In React, for every DOM object create a “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a
					representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy. A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a
					real DOM object, but it has't the real power to directly change what’s on the screen.

					Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is much faster because nothing gets drawn onscreen.
					It looks like as editing a blueprint.
				</aside>
				<h2>The VIRTUAL DOM</h2>
				<p>The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept
					in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called
					<strong>reconciliation</strong>.

						When new elements are added to the UI, a virtual DOM, which is represented as a tree is created. Each
						element is a node on this tree.

						If the state of any of these elements changes, a new virtual DOM tree is
						created.
						This tree is then compared with the previous virtual DOM tree.

						Once this is done, the virtual DOM calculates the best possible method to make these changes to the real
						DOM. This ensures that there are minimal operations on the real DOM.
